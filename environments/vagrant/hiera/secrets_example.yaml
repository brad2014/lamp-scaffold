# This is an example file that contains passwords configured into your system.
#
# Copy the file  to environments/vagrant/hiera/private/<hostname>/secrets.yaml
# The private directory is ignored by git, so it won't be checked in or pushed.
# The hostname is from the Vagrantfile (e.g. dev.example.com)
#
# The passwords should be random and unique.  An easy way:
# % openssl rand -base64 20 | cut -c 1-20
